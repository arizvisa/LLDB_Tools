#LLDB hit Tracer

Simpler instruction count tool to see how much code coverage a particle instance hits. Runc func.py in IDA to get a list of breakpoints and pass that into the script as well as the name of the program to trace. Will output percentage hit and breakpoints not hit. Works on shared libraries as well see program usage for details.
